###Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> > rm -iR    - Removes all directories and files at a specified location recursively (R), but also allows you to examine each directory before removal (i). Be careful when using rm -R, there is no undo.

> > pushd     - Allows you to go to a place further into your file system, while saving the location you last were.

> > popd      - Brings you back to the saved location after using the pushd command.

> > cd ..     - Brings the current working directory up one level.

> > pwd       - Reveals the current working directory.

> > ">"       - Takes output from the command on the left and writes it into the file on the right.

> > ">>"      - Takes output from command on left and appends it to file on right.

> > "|"       - Pipes output from one command (on left) and to use as input for another command (on right).

> > ls *      - Displays a list of all items in a directory, and the items in directories below. Only use for small directories.
